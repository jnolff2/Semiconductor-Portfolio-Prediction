# Stock-Price-Prediction



The 5-Day-Prediction folder contains an image of our model's direction price prediction based on the closing price of the date in the image.  The number is predicting the directional movement of the stock price from the closing price of that day to the closing price 5 days in the future.  A positive number indicates the user should go long that stock and a negative number indicates the user should short the stock.

The Recent-Performance-Breakdown folder contains an image that shows some custom performance metrics we used to measure our portfolio.  It includes the accuracy of our predictions, the average weekly percentage returns if the predictions were acted on, a breakdown of long vs. short prediction performance, etc.
